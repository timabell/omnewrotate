Known Issues:
	* I'm not getting updated results if I only open
	  /sys/class/backlight/pcf50633-bl/actual_brightness once
	  which means I need to open it on every cycle.
	  Since it's in memory and not an actual file, wast should
	  not be too much
	* brightness doesn't work in frameworkd distributions, planned for "soon"
