2008-12-09 - 0.5.1 - Automagically lazy
	* same as 0.5.0 plus auto tools magic
	* desktop icon
	* places a starter script

2008-11-19 - 0.5.0 - Lazy edition
	* uses a second thread for reading the accellerometer packets
	* drops Fabian's changes (not that they weren't good, just not
	  needed any more)
	* adds flags (look at display_help() or ./rotate -h)
	* drops packets with 0 value coordinates (I got bogus packets
	  like that so I decided to drop them, if you feel you get good
	  packets with 0 value, you can use '-0' as an argument to take
	  them in account).
	* top -d 1 -p <PID> shows 0.0% CPU usage (of omnewrotate) even
	  during rotation
	* seems to waste a little too much memory (some stuff could be
	  done with one number and bitwise operations instead of several
	  numbers, I wonder how much that will improve and if it's worth
	  the effort...)
	* only output outside of debug mode are real errors

2008-10-14 - 0.3.0
	* dims while rotating and doesn't rotate if dimmed, sleeping for 5s

2008-09-22 - 0.2.1
	* more heuristic fixes (hopefully really fix when laying around, and
	  turned up)
	* workaround with alarm() for the accelerometer read-hang problem
	* sleeping for 100ms seems to get cpu usage quite low (0% to 0.9%)

2008-09-22 - 0.2.0
	* greatly improves heuristics
	* fixed heuristics when laying around, and turned up

2008-09-21 - 0.1.1 - First brown paper bag release
	* improves heuristics

2008-09-21 - 0.1.0 - First release.
	* makes some rotations
